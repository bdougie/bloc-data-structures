## Discoveries in GO

Working with Linked List was not too hard, since I follow this pattern
already in the [Stacks and Queues](https://github.com/bdougie/bloc-data-structures/blob/master/stacks_and_queues/explanation.md) checkpoint. 

Because Go is low level the examples of Stacks and Queues I found used
Linked List, which is where I got my inspiration from. 

Benchmarking was interesting, since it is handled differently than in
Ruby. Benchmarking is handled from the Go [testing](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) library.

I still appreciate choosing Go to learn these concepts to force myself
to learn how things are built rather than just reaching for standard
library methods.
